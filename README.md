A collection of design patterns for the Go language. 

### Behavioural

| Name | Description | Status | 
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| [Command Pattern](behavioural/command/) | Encapsulate requests as objects. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Observer Pattern](behavioural/observer/) | Extensible implementation of one-to-many relationships between objects. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Template Method Pattern](behavioural/templateMethod/) | Defer steps of algorithms to subclasses. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Iterator Pattern](behavioural/iterator/) | Abstract the iteration of objects. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [State Pattern](behavioural/state/) | Allowing objects to alter behaviour when an internal state changes. | :heavy_check_mark: |

### Structural

| Name | Description | Status | 
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| [Decorator Pattern](structural/decorator/) | Attach additional functionality to objects dynamically. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Adapter Pattern](structural/adapter/) | Give an object an interface that is compatible with a different system. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Facade Pattern](structural/facade/) | Hide the complexities of a class behind a simple interface. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Composite Pattern](structural/composite/) | Represent part-whole hierarchies through tree structures. | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| [Proxy Pattern](structural/proxy/) | Control access to another object by providing a surrogate. | :heavy_check_mark: |

### Creational

| Name | Description | Status | 
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| [Factory Method Pattern](creational/factoryMethod/) | Let subclasses of a factory define what objects to create. | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Singleton Pattern](creational/singleton/) | Ensure that there is only one instance of a class globally. |:heavy_check_mark: |
