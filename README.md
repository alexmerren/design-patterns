# Design Patterns in Golang 

A repository that contains some popular design patterns implemented in Golang.

I am basing a lot of the information contained in this repository from the book
"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"

## Design Patterns

The design patterns covered are:

 * [Command Pattern](command/)
 * [Decorator Pattern](decorator/)
 * [Factory Method Pattern](factoryMethod/)
 * [Observer Pattern](observer/)
 * [Singleton Pattern](singleton/)
